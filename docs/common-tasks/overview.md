# Overview

This section is dedicated to walking through examples of common tasks that you would perform using the API. 

Pulling and paging through audit logs? Pushing a config to multiple Birds? Creating new Flocks and assigning users and devices? Mass creating Canarytokens?

Feel free to suggest additions to this section, we want to make your API experience, and that of all our customers, better! 

We also have a collection of [useful scripts](https://github.com/thinkst/canary-utils)  that we've either given to, or had a customer give to us. You may find them useful to use in conjunction with the following examples.
