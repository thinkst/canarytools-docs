# Introduction 

Welcome to the Canarytools API Documentation.

If you're new here, take a look at our [Getting Started](guide/getting-started) section which will walk you through finding your API key, determining your Console's unique domain, and making your first calls to the API.

For FAQs, step-by-step Bird and Console setup instructions, and other support issues, head on over to our [Help Page](https://help.canary.tools/).

If you have any support related issues that you haven't been able to find an answer to, please feel free to [drop us a mail](mailto:support@canary.tools). We're always happy to answer your questions.

These docs have undergone a revamp and we are trying to improve them to make them easier to follow, while explaining the API in greater detail.

If you do see an issue, or feel that things could be improved, feel free to click on the `Help us improve this page!` links and let us know on [our Github repo](https://github.com/thinkst/canarytools-docs) how we can improve. Alternatively, let us know [by mail](mailto:support@canary.tools) and we'll look into it.
